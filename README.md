# Yoshi API
This api module is for interview of startyoshi.com. I did not write a single line of Ruby on Rails and write this api module based on requirement in two weeks. So some of the code is not so good and well structure. 
  
Example api host:  
https://yoshi-api.herokuapp.com/nearest_gas?lat=37.77801&lng=-100.4119076
It will be a little bit slow because of the heroku free plan when launch from sleep
